		<h1>How it all went down</h1>
		<p>We foud our inspiration outside of the box for this Project. Gabriel was born and raised in Las Vegas. Instead of doing a project about the bars local to Rutgers, we decided to try something fun. We went with all the casinos and bars on the Las Vegas Strip. You will not find any bars in Las Vegas on the strip. Most of them are attached to a casino. So we decided to add them to our project. We display information about casinos as well in our pages dropdown menu. We Have also taken some inspiration for this project with the fact that it was assigned during Oktoberfest. For any that are seasoned drinkers, you may notice that our beer list has a lot of specialty beers. We chose to add more beers to our project so that we could keep things entertaining. Also adding to this project is food items and some liquors. So not only at a bar can a person order a drink, they can also get their favorite bar foods such as chicken fingers, fries or mozzarella sticks! Some of our drinkers that can be found in the drinker pages have food items as their favorite thing to order at bars they frequent. If you would like to specifically query our tables such as finding if your name is in our list then pleae click the SQL Interface Page. We hope you enjoy this app, and please feel free to play around and learn more about the drinkers that visit the bars in Las Vegas.</p>
